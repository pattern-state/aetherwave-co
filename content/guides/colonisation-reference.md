## Resource Requirements for Major Materials

The following materials are the most commonly required resources for construction, listed in order of typical quantity needed:

1. **Steel**: Required for all installations, often 25-30% of total mass
2. **CMM Composite**: Critical for large structures, typically 15-20% of total mass
3. **Aluminium**: Essential structural component, 10-15% of total mass
4. **Titanium**: For strength and durability, 8-15% of total mass
5. **Building Fabricators & Structural Regulators**: Important for surface installations

*Note: Medium-sized settlements typically require exactly 2x the resources of small settlements, while large settlements require exactly 3x the resources of small settlements of the same type.*

## Important Construction Notes

1. **First Installation Surcharge**: Your primary installation has a resource surcharge:
   - Tier 1: +16% additional resources
   - Tier 2: +32% additional resources 
   - Tier 3: +20% additional resources

2. **Landing Pad Discrepancies**: Many settlements advertise different landing pad sizes than they actually provide in-game. Settlement variants don't always have matching pad size - some Tier 2 Medium installations have Large pads.

3. **Construction Point Strategy**: Large settlements provide 2x the Tier 3 construction points of standard installations, making them more efficient for progression.

4. **Bug Alert**: Some installations construct incorrectly:
   - Eirene Satellite builds as a Scientific Installation
   - Ichnaea Relay builds as a Communications Installation
