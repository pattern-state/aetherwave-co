**Greetings, Commander!**

I'm Commander Pattern State, and I've put together this guide to help fellow commanders across the galaxy.

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

## Introduction

The Trailblazers update (February 2025) introduced one of the most significant additions to Elite Dangerous: System Colonisation. For the first time, commanders can claim unoccupied systems, build stations, and establish new hubs of civilisation throughout the galaxy. The Bubble is no longer static - it's now expanding through player-led, free-form development.

This guide combines official information with practical advice from early colonisers to help you establish your own corner of the galaxy.

## Getting Started: The Claim Process

### Finding a System to Colonise

According to official documentation, you must find an unpopulated system within 16 light years of an existing populated system. You can scan potential star systems in advance to see the number of available slots for construction, with some systems offering more valuable opportunities than others.

**Important**: The Colonisation Ship will arrive at the location marked with a flag on the system map when you take the claim. Choose this location carefully as it will be your primary construction hub.

When choosing a system, consider:
- Proximity to populated space (for easier hauling)
- System features (stars, planets, rings, landable bodies)
- Number of available build slots
- Your long-term goals for the system

### Making Your Claim

To begin the colonisation process:
1. Purchase a claim with credits from a Colonisation Contact (CC) at a faction in populated space
2. Deploy a Colonisation Beacon in your chosen system within 24 hours (or the claim is revoked)
3. Select and place a primary starport in a pre-determined location

After these steps, a Colonisation Ship (CS) will arrive in your system. This vessel is larger than a Drake-Class Carrier and serves as your construction hub.

### The Construction Timeline

Once the CS arrives, you'll need to deliver a specific list of commodities based on your chosen starport type. You must complete this within the deadline (typically 28 days) or all progress will be lost. Many commanders recommend ensuring you have the full 28 days available when planning your colonisation effort.

When all required commodities are delivered, your primary starport will appear in partial construction and will be finished after the weekly server tick. The starport initially appears as an abandoned structure with inactive vendors and services.

## Understanding the Colony Tech Tree

### The Tier System

Colonisation facilities are organised in tiers:

- **Tier 1 (T1)**: Basic outposts, small settlements, and installations
- **Tier 2 (T2)**: Medium stations like Coriolis and Asteroid Bases
- **Tier 3 (T3)**: Large stations such as Ocellus and Orbis

The tier system operates on a progression model using Construction Points:
- Building T1 installations earns points toward T2 structures
- Building T2 installations earns points toward T3 structures
- Tier 2 large ground settlements are particularly valuable, providing 2x Tier 3 construction tokens
- Note that the construction token cost doubles for a third Tier 2/3 port, so plan your builds carefully

Each construction adds or subtracts various system attributes like: Population Increase, Max Population, Security, Tech Level, Wealth, Standard of Living, and Development Level.

### The T3 First Strategy

Interestingly, you can bypass the tier progression by building a T3 station as your primary installation. This approach is particularly useful for systems with few build slots, as those with only 4 slots may not provide enough construction points to build a T3 object later in the development cycle.

Be warned: this strategy is extremely resource-intensive and typically requires squadron support.
