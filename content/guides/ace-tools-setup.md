# A.C.E. Exploration Squadron Tools Setup Guide

**Greetings, Commander!**

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

This guide will help you install, configure, and get the most out of the essential software that powers our squadron’s efforts, ensuring your journey is as seamless as it is rewarding.

## Tools Overview

### **Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC)**  
A bridge between Elite Dangerous and external services like Inara.cz, EDDB, and more, allowing you to track your activities and share data with others.

### **BGS Tally Plugin**  
An EDMC plugin that tracks and reports your personal BGS and Thargoid War activities, crucial to supporting Operations Group in understanding player effort in complex situations (especially against opposing forces). It's also a good way of understanding your own personal effect on the galaxy.

### **Elite Observatory**  
A standalone tool that monitors Elite Dangerous journals to identify interesting celestial bodies, making your exploration a bit more targetted. It feels much more like a Picard experience, vs the pre-astrobiometrics era Janeway without it.. ;-)

### **EDMC Overlay Plugin**  
Adds an in-game overlay to display useful information from EDMC directly in your cockpit.

### **Elite Dangerous Odyssey Materials Helper**  
A crazy useful tool to track your materials, plan upgrades, and pinpoint the best locations for gathering resources. Whether you're unlocking engineers, crafting blueprints, or upgrading weapons and suits, this app ensures your efforts are targeted and efficient.

   - The app will display all the materials required for your goals, how many you currently have, and where to find them.  

4. **Use the Overlay Feature**:  
   - The app offers an overlay that provides material information while you're at data terminals, helping you decide what's worth collecting.

5. **Enhance Your Gameplay**:  
   - Export your wishlist from EDSY into the app for better tracking.  
   - Share your loadouts and wishlists with other commanders to coordinate efforts.  

> *CMDR Pattern State's Note*: This makes the mat hunt and trading process a lot less complex and much easier to understand, particularly if you're new to the whole thing, as I was very recently.

### Step 4: Install Elite Observatory
1. **Download Observatory**:  
   Visit [Elite Observatory Releases](https://observatory.xjph.net/release) and download the latest version.

2. **Install and Configure**:  
   Follow the installer prompts. Once installed, you can enable pop-ups or text-to-speech notifications. Customise the filters to define what "interesting" means to you.

3. **Install BioInsights Plugin**:  
   - Visit [BioInsights](https://edjp.colacube.net/observatory) and download the plugin.  
   - If Observatory Core is already installed, double-click the downloaded file, and it will integrate with the Observatory app.  
   - This plugin predicts biological signals on planets from FSS scan data, helping you decide if a planet is worth exploring.  
   - **Note**: CMDR Pattern State hasn’t tested other plugins on this site. Your mileage may vary.
