**Greetings, Commander!**

I'm Commander Pattern State, and I've put together this guide to help fellow commanders across the galaxy.

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

## Economy and Factions

According to official documentation, System Colonisation is seamlessly connected with Powerplay and the Background Simulation:

- Newly colonised systems only have the faction from which the colonisation claim was purchased
- If you buy a claim from a preferred faction, it will be brought over to your system
- If a different Powerplay faction conquers the system, the architect remains in control of the system development and resources
- The architect stays the same forever, regardless of political changes

## Expansion and Future Development

The official documentation confirms that expanding The Bubble with colonies can have a galaxy-wide effect:
- Creating new trade routes for traders
- Establishing new hubs for explorers to use as home bases before venturing into deep space
- Building mini-Bubbles with various economies to haul goods faster for new colonies

Long-range colonisation in deep space presents additional challenges, as returning to the Core Systems for goods becomes a significant journey.

## Known Issues and Updates

The colonisation system is still evolving, with changes happening during maintenance periods. Industrial facilities, for example, may change the commodities they offer after server updates.

Environmental variables like rings, landable planets, and stars may also affect colonisation options in ways that are still being discovered by the community.

### Known Issues and Tips

#### Economy Considerations
- Systems with "Colony" economy type indicate they haven't yet adopted a specific economy
- This limits the items available for sale in ports until the economy develops

#### Visual Bugs
- Some completed buildings may display differently in your system than what you originally built
- This is a known visual issue only - the backend data should correctly reflect your chosen facility

## Advanced Strategies

### Multiple System Management

As you gain experience, you might find yourself managing multiple colonisation projects simultaneously. This requires careful prioritisation of resources and hauling efforts across different systems.

### Complementary Economies

Building complementary economies across your colonised systems can create self-sustaining networks, reducing dependency on established systems and making expansion more efficient.
