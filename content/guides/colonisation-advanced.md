## Installation Prerequisites and Dependencies

Many installations in the colonisation system have specific prerequisites that aren't explicitly stated in-game. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for efficient planning:

| Installation Type | Required Prerequisite |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Tourism Settlements | Any Satellite Installation |
| Tourist Installations | Any Tourism Settlement |
| Military Hubs | Military Installation (Vacuna, Alastor) |
| Industrial Hubs | Mining Outpost Installation |
| Security Stations | Relay Installation |
| Research Stations | Bio Research Settlement |
| Exploration Hub | Communication Station |

Failure to build prerequisites first will result in the game preventing you from constructing the dependent facility, potentially derailing your colonisation timeline.

## First Installation Resource Surcharge

Your primary starport (first installation) requires significantly more resources than subsequent structures of the same type. This surcharge varies by tier:

| Tier | Resource Surcharge |
|------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | +16% resources |
| Tier 2 | +32% resources |
| Tier 3 | +20% resources |

For example, a Tier 3 Ocellus Starport normally requires approximately 209,000 tons of commodities, but as a first installation, it would require about 250,800 tons â€“ a difference of over 40,000 tons!

This surcharge makes the T3-first strategy even more resource-intensive than it initially appears.

## System Attribute Maximization

Different installations have dramatically different effects on your system's attributes. Here are the most impactful installations for each attribute:

| System Attribute | Best Installation | Maximum Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Security | Military Hub | +10 |
| Technology | Large Bio Research Settlement or Scientific Hub | +10 |
| Wealth | Extraction Hub | +10 |
| Standard of Living | Government Installation | +6 |
| Development | Ocellus/Orbis Starport | +8 |
| Population | Large Port | +10 (+10 Max Population) |

Strategic placement of these high-impact installations can dramatically shape your system's development. For example, if you're creating a high-tech research system, prioritizing Scientific Hubs and Bio Research Settlements will rapidly increase your technology level.

## Construction Point Optimization

Not all Tier 2 installations are created equal when it comes to earning Tier 3 construction points:

| Installation Type | Tier 3 Points Earned |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Standard Tier 2 Installation | 1 |
| Large Settlement (Agriculture/Mining/Industrial/Military/Bio/Tourist) | 2 |

This makes large settlements twice as efficient for earning Tier 3 points, allowing you to progress to advanced structures more quickly.

## Known Game Issues and Workarounds

The colonisation system contains some known bugs and inconsistencies:

- **Installation Type Mismatches**: Some installations appear correctly in the menu but build as different types:
  - Eirene Satellite builds as a Scientific Installation
  - Ichnaea Relay builds as a Communications Installation

- **Landing Pad Discrepancies**: Several settlements advertise different landing pad sizes than what they actually provide in-game. Always verify the landing pad size before committing to a build.

- **Visual Rendering Issues**: Some completed buildings may display differently in your system than what you originally selected. This is purely a visual issue and doesn't affect functionality.

Always consult the Colony Planner Tool or DaftMav's spreadsheet for the most current information before committing resources to construction.

## Economy Development Strategies

Your system's economy is determined by the cumulative effect of your installations. Each installation either establishes an initial economy type or influences the development of existing economies:

| Economy Type | Key Installations for Development |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| High Tech | Scientific Hub, Research Installations, Bio Settlements |
| Industrial | Industrial Hub, Industrial Settlements |
| Military | Military Hub, Security Stations |
| Agricultural | Agricultural Installations, Agricultural Settlements |
| Tourism | Tourist Installations, Tourism Settlements |
| Extraction | Extraction Hub, Mining Settlements |
| Refinery | Refinery Hub |

Creating a focused economy by building complementary installations can maximize trade opportunities and system specialization. For example, a High Tech system benefits most from multiple research installations, while a Military system gains synergy from security stations and military outposts.
