# Materials Helper Setup Guide

**Greetings, Commander!**

Welcome, brave members of the A.C.E. Exploration Squadron!  

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Helper**:  
   Visit the [Odyssey Materials Helper Releases Page](https://github.com/jixxed/ed-odyssey-materials-helper/releases) and download the latest `.msi` file.

2. **Install the Application**:  
   Run the downloaded `.msi` file to install the application.

3. **Configure the Helper**:  
   - Launch the app, which will read your Elite Dangerous journal files
   - Select the engineers you want to unlock and the upgrades you want to craft
   - The app will display all the materials required for your goals, how many you currently have, and where to find them

4. **Use the Overlay Feature**:  
   - The app offers an overlay that provides material information while you're at data terminals, helping you decide what's worth collecting

5. **Enhance Your Gameplay**:  
   - Export your wishlist from EDSY into the app for better tracking
   - Share your loadouts and wishlists with other commanders to coordinate efforts

> *CMDR Pattern State's Note*: This makes the mat hunt and trading process a lot less complex and much easier to understand, particularly if you're new to the whole thing, as I was very recently.

## Testing Your Setup
Launch Elite Dangerous and verify that the Materials Helper is reading your journal files and tracking materials correctly.
