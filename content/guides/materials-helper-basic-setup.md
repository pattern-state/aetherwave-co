# Materials Helper Setup Guide

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Helper**:  
   Visit the [Odyssey Materials Helper Releases Page](https://github.com/jixxed/ed-odyssey-materials-helper/releases) and download the latest `.msi` file.

2. **Install the Application**:  
   Run the downloaded `.msi` file to install the application.

3. **Configure the Helper**:  
   - Launch the app, which will read your Elite Dangerous journal files
   - Select the engineers you want to unlock and the upgrades you want to craft
   - The app will display all the materials required for your goals, how many you currently have, and where to find them

4. **Use the Overlay Feature**:  
   - The app offers an overlay that provides material information while you're at data terminals, helping you decide what's worth collecting

5. **Enhance Your Gameplay**:  
   - Export your wishlist from EDSY into the app for better tracking
   - Share your loadouts and wishlists with other commanders to coordinate efforts

> *CMDR Pattern State's Note*: This makes the mat hunt and trading process a lot less complex and much easier to understand, particularly if you're new to the whole thing, as I was very recently.

## Testing Your Setup
Launch Elite Dangerous and verify that the Materials Helper is reading your journal files and tracking materials correctly.
