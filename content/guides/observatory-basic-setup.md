# Elite Observatory Setup Guide

**Greetings, Commander!**

Welcome, brave members of the A.C.E. Exploration Squadron!  

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download Observatory**:  
   Visit [Elite Observatory Releases](https://observatory.xjph.net/release) and download the latest version.

2. **Install and Configure**:  
   Follow the installer prompts. Once installed, you can enable pop-ups or text-to-speech notifications. Customise the filters to define what "interesting" means to you.

3. **Install BioInsights Plugin**:  
   - Visit [BioInsights](https://edjp.colacube.net/observatory) and download the plugin
   - If Observatory Core is already installed, double-click the downloaded file, and it will integrate with the Observatory app
   - This plugin predicts biological signals on planets from FSS scan data, helping you decide if a planet is worth exploring
   - **Note**: CMDR Pattern State hasn't tested other plugins on this site. Your mileage may vary.

## Testing Your Setup
Launch Elite Dangerous and verify that Observatory is detecting your journal files and providing notifications as configured.
