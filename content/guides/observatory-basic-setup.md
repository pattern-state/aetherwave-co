# Elite Observatory Setup Guide

## Installation Steps

1. **Download Observatory**:  
   Visit [Elite Observatory Releases](https://observatory.xjph.net/release) and download the latest version.

2. **Install and Configure**:  
   Follow the installer prompts. Once installed, you can enable pop-ups or text-to-speech notifications. Customise the filters to define what "interesting" means to you.

3. **Install BioInsights Plugin**:  
   - Visit [BioInsights](https://edjp.colacube.net/observatory) and download the plugin
   - If Observatory Core is already installed, double-click the downloaded file, and it will integrate with the Observatory app
   - This plugin predicts biological signals on planets from FSS scan data, helping you decide if a planet is worth exploring
   - **Note**: CMDR Pattern State hasn't tested other plugins on this site. Your mileage may vary.

## Testing Your Setup
Launch Elite Dangerous and verify that Observatory is detecting your journal files and providing notifications as configured.
