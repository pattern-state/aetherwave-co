# EDMC Plugin Setup Guide

**Greetings, Commander!**

Welcome, brave members of the A.C.E. Exploration Squadron!  

As we traverse the vastness of the galaxy, delving into exploration, combat, and the intricacies of the Background Simulation (BGS), having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference. Whether you're charting unclaimed systems, defending humanity, or shaping the political landscape, these tools will ensure you're always one step ahead.

## BGS Tally Plugin
An EDMC plugin that tracks and reports your personal BGS and Thargoid War activities, crucial to supporting Operations Group in understanding player effort in complex situations (especially against opposing forces). It's also a good way of understanding your own personal effect on the galaxy.

## EDMC Overlay Plugin Setup

1. **Download the Overlay**:  
   Visit the [EDMC Overlay Releases Page](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay/releases) and download the latest `.msi` installer.

2. **Install the Plugin**:  
   During installation, you may encounter a **"Windows protected your PC"** warning. If you used the official link, you can safely approve the installation.  

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   After restarting EDMC, the overlay should display useful information in your cockpit during gameplay. This plugin requires Elite Dangerous to run in "Windowed" or "Borderless Fullscreen" mode.

## Troubleshooting
- **Plugins Not Loading**: Check if they are in the correct EDMC plugins folder and restart EDMC.
- **Overlay Not Working**: Ensure Elite Dangerous is running in "Windowed" or "Borderless Fullscreen" mode.
