# INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT

Woke to chaos this morning. Ironic, really - the nickname "pattern-state" came from my time in the Pilots Federation Data Analytics Division. Fifteen years of pattern analysis does that to you. "Even your subconscious thinks in algorithms," they'd say, finding me passed out at my desk after 36-hour data mining sessions, screens still scrolling with pilot behaviour patterns.

Was meant to be a simple day - roll out of bed, short hop to Cocijo in the ol' Python, observe whatever the Thargoids were up to from a safe distance. Instead, found myself in completely the wrong system, my alarm blaring, me feeling a bit of 'ah no, this isn't good" in confusion. Not exactly the peaceful morning one hopes for aboard the "Psychedelic Breakfast".

Even better news.... I was five systems away. No idea why... I guess I'm a guest on the carrier so who knows. Five systems. Realistically about 15 precious minutes between me and the "final" Titan going boom. I don't buy that this is the last we'll hear of them, there's too much mystery around what they're up to, and to be fair, if some aliens had tried to commit genocide on my species with a biological weapon, I'd probably have a grudge to bear too.

By the time I got into the python and jumped back, it was over. I've got a beautiful holo-capture of what being late looks like that will adorn my cockpit for a while. So much for my reputation of being able to process data in my sleep.

The explosion... well, yeah, that was a lot. I came in a bit hot with the new sco drive, and managed to pretty much cleanly take off my new paint job. That's another tick in the 'excellent morning so far' list.

But it's the signal that matters now. The Titan made a noise. Everyone in the squadron clocked it, but sadly I missed it. I got hold of a spectrographic analysis from some random source on GalRed(dit), and in all my years of pattern analysis, I've never seen anything quite like it. The Thargoids weren't just attacking - they were transmitting something. The signal burst was picked up by every scanner in the system.

Initial community analysis is promising (Pattern #558483ff), but the source data is compressed, degraded. Not good. We need better. I've already reached out to contacts - someone must have captured this in higher fidelity.

Haven't had time to properly investigate why the carrier jumped. Too focused on these signals. The nav logs can wait - this is more important. Though I admit, part of me wonders if the carrier's nav computer spotted something in those patterns that we're still trying to understand. Wouldn't be the first time a machine noticed something while humans were sleeping.
